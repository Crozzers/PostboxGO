# PostboxGO

A postbox spotting app.

Have you ever noticed that UK postboxes have a Royal cipher on the front that tells you when it was installed?
Once you see it, you can't unsee it and this app can help you track the postboxes that you spot.

The goal of the app is to visit as many different postboxes as possible and track them all.

Simply walk up to a new postbox, open the app and click the register postbox button. From there you
can select the exact postbox using the postbox name and ID number, as well as the map view shown.
Select the monarch that appears on the postbox and save.
