# PostboxGO

A postbox spotting app.

Have you ever noticed that UK postboxes have a Royal cipher on the front that tells you when it was installed?
Once you see it, you can't unsee it and this app can help you track the postboxes that you spot.

The goal of the app is to visit as many different postboxes as possible and track them using this app.

Simply walk up to a new postbox, open the app and click the register postbox button. From there you
can select the exact postbox using the postbox name and ID number, as well as the map view shown.
Select the monarch that appears on the postbox and save.

## Installation

To install PostboxGO, visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Crozzers/PostboxGO/releases) and
download the latest APK. You can install the app from there.

To update the app, simply go back to the releases page, download the newest version and install it.

Unfortunately, the app is not widely available on Google Play due to their onerous testing
requirements for individual developers. However, the app is available in an opt-in closed testing
track. If you'd like to join, [send me an email](mailto:captaincrozzers@gmail.com).

view postboxes, as well as all the nuances that come along with that.
