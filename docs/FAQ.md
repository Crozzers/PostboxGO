# FAQ

## Why do you need location access?

The GPS location is converted to a postcode, which is then sent to an API to locate which postboxes
are near you, and which one you're trying to register.

The point of the app is to get you to physically visit as many postboxes as possible, which is why
we don't let you select an arbitrary location to add postboxes from.

Your location is only accessed when adding a new postbox. You can see exactly what this data is used
for in our [privacy policy](../privacy-notice.md).


## Does this app sync my progress online?

No. This app currently only saves your progress to your device. You can import/export your save
file in the app settings if you wish to continue your progress on a new device.
